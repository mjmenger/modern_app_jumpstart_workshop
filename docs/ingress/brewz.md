# Install Brewz with ArgoCD

In this section, you will deploy the Brewz microservices using Argo CD.

## Update Argo CD Application Manifest

You will need to update the Brewz Argo CD manifest to match your environment.  

1. Open the `manifests/brewz-subchart.yaml` file in your forked version of the **primary** repository.
1. Find the following variables and replace them with your information:

    | Variable        | Value           |
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    | \<GITHUB_USER\>   | github username |

    Your file should look similar to the example below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: brewz
      namespace: argocd
      finalizers:
        - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        path: manifests/brewz
        repoURL: https://github.com/codygreen/modern_app_jumpstart_workshop.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
      destination:
        namespace: default
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          selfHeal: true
          prune: true
    ```

1. Save the file. Stage the changes, and commit to your local **primary** repository. Push the changes to your remote **primary** repository.

## Deploy the manifest

To deploy the Brewz Argo CD application, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/brewz-subchart.yaml
```

## View the Argo CD Application

1. Open the Argo CD UDF Access Method under the K3s server
  ![Argo CD Sync](../assets/argo_sync.jpg)
1. Click on the argo-cd-demo application in the Argo CD UI and inspect the deployed services and policies

    - You should see the individual services as well as the `rate-limit-policy` resource from day 1 of the workshop

## Inspect the NGINX Ingress Controller Configuration

Now that Argo CD has deployed out application let's take a look at the NGINX Ingress Controller Virtual Server resources.

**Note:** Refer to the [VirtualServer docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources/) for more information.

```bash
kubectl get virtualserver
```

Your output should look similar to:

```bash
NAME    STATE   HOST               IP         PORTS      AGE
brewz   Valid   brewz.f5demo.com   10.1.1.5   [80,443]   29m
```

Let's take a deeper look at the configuration:

```shell
kubectl describe virtualserver brewz
```

Your output should look similar to:

```shell

A few items of interest in the output:

- Spec.Routes.Action:
  - "/" -> spa
  - "/" with cookie `app_version=dark` -> spa-dark
  - "/api" -> api
    - with a policy named rate-limit-policy
  - "/images" -> rewrite policy to the api upstream
  - "/api/inventory" -> /api/inventory of inventory service
  - "/api/recommendations" -> /api/recommendations of recommendations service



## Next Steps

Now that you have a base application deployed, let's take a deeper look at the [VirtualServer resource](virtualserver.md).
