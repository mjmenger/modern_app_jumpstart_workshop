# F5 Distributed Cloud Kubernetes Site

In this lab, you will evaluate alternative options for publishing services from a K8s cluster leveraging F5 Distributed Cloud.

## Resources

- [F5 XC Create a Kubernetes Site Docs](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/site-management/create-k8s-site)

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have already completed the [NGINX Ingress lab](../ingress/README.md) and have running instances of the Brewz microservices in your K8s cluster. If not, please complete those steps first.

## K8s Site Deployment  

1. [Create a site token](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/site-management/create-k8s-site)
2. [Prepare a manifest file](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/site-management/create-k8s-site) using the [manifest template](https://gitlab.com/volterra.io/volterra-ce/-/blob/master/k8s/ce_k8s.yml)
3. Update the manifest file with the required attributes:
    - **ClusterName**: *username-k8s-site*
    - **Latitude**: *47.608013*
    - **Longitude**: *-122.335167*
    - **Token**: *token generated in step 1*

**Note:** Your manifest file contains a sensitive token, please do not commit it back into your repository.

## Deploy

Now that you have created your custom manifest file, we will deploy the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f f5xc_k8s_site.yaml
```

Verify the deployment by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ves-system -o=wide
```

## Next Steps

The F5 Distributed Cloud documentation is very well written and offers detailed instructions for completing the remaining registry steps.  Please follow the remaining instructions in the [F5 XC Create a Kubernetes Site Docs - Single Node Site Registration](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/site-management/create-k8s-site#single-node-site-registration) and then come back to the lab guide.

Once your Kubernetes site is up and ready, proceed to configuring your [HTTP Load Balancer](http_lb.md)
